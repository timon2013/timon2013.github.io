            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my website! This is the first post on this blog, and hopefully not the last :)</p>
<p>I decided to create a simple website that I won't have to spend a lot of time maintaining and managing. Previously, I mainly operated on the Wordpress system, but this time I opted for Docusaurus.io solution. This allows me to integrate with the Github environment and write posts using Markdown.</p>]]></content:encoded>
